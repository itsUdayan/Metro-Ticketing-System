Metro Ticketing System with Fingerprint Authentication
A model metro payment system using fingerprint verification and a web-based admin portal.

Hardware: ESP32 with AS608 fingerprint sensor, servo gate control.

Backend: Node.js (Express) with MongoDB.

Frontend: Responsive web app for admin functions.

Key Features:

Users register fingerprints; system assigns unique IDs.

Users scan fingerprint at source station and again at destination station â€” fare is dynamically calculated and balance is deducted.

Same source/destination scan prevention logic to avoid double charges.

Admin can:

Register users

Add balance to user accounts

View trip history

Add stations and fare mappings

Real-time communication between hardware and backend via API polling.

Demo version uses 1 fingerprint sensor with manual station selection on web frontend.
